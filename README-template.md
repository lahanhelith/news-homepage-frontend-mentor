## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I used CSS grid to get a layout which is close to the desktop design and the mobile design which I'm satisfied with but seeking to improve. However, it was a struggle to get the navbar to be responsive and in getting the design of the sidebar right but I managed to make one close enough. During the search for solutions I finally understood how you can use the data attribute in html to store variables for use in JavaScript.

### Continued development

I want to use aria and data attributes even more withing the html as I understood how aria helps with screen reader accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Navbar Tutorial using HTML, CSS & JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0&t=2439s) - This video by Kevin Powell helped me a lot as he uses aria and data attributes to make a navbar that is responsive.
